description: Running native-compiled Jac in the browser as WebAssembly - the client->native import edge (client code imports a native Jac module; the build emits /static/<stem>.wasm and binds lazy async stubs), `set_na_env` for modules with app FFI, plus the raw mechanics underneath - `__jac_glob_init()`, BigInt i64 marshalling, externs-as-wasm-imports, WebAssembly.Module.imports introspection, and standalone `jac nacompile --target wasm32`. Load when building in-browser native compute: a game loop, simulation, or client-side hot loop. Pair with `jac-cl-components` (the page side) and `jac-native` (the native subset).

The native codespace's second target: instead of a host binary, your module's native code compiles to **WebAssembly** and runs in the browser, driven by a client page - native-speed compute with no server round-trip. Jac's own wasm linker produces the module; no emscripten, no `wasm-ld`. Native placement is inferred from extern-decl imports (`import from raylib { def ... ; }`) and the code that uses them; pure compute with no FFI surface (like `count_primes` below) has nothing to infer from, so you pin it native in `jac.toml` (`[placement.pins] "main.count_primes" = "native"`) or pin the kernel module native (see `jac-codespaces`).

## The first-class path: importing a native module from client code

Keep the native code in its own module - pin it native (or let an
anchor-free kernel infer native) - and import it from client code with a plain
import - the client -> native twin of the RPC bridge:

```
# host.jac (any client module)
import from .kernel { count_primes }     # kernel.jac (native-placed) -> wasm edge

async def show {
    print(await count_primes(20000));    # lazy: first call fetches + instantiates
}
```

What the one import does:

- **Emission**: the client build compiles `kernel.jac` (a native dependency, so `pub` is its export marker) to
  `/static/kernel.wasm` (+ a `.wasm.imports.json` manifest). The module needs
  no other importer; `jac.toml [gc]` settings apply (e.g. `default = "none"`
  for a zero-RC artifact).
- **Binding**: each imported name becomes a generated async stub
  (`__na_bind` in `@jac/wasm_host`) that instantiates the module on first
  call and dispatches to its export - so calls are `await`ed, exactly like
  client calls to server endpoints. `__jac_glob_init()` and BigInt marshalling
  of the *stub-crossed scalars still apply* (an int return arrives as BigInt).
- **Direction decides the crossing**: the same import written in *server*
  code is the server -> native ctypes crossing and executes the module
  server-side; written in client code it is the wasm edge and compiles to
  nothing under Python. The edge claims only decidedly-native targets -
  pinned `"native"`, already native-compiled, or carrying a real
  native anchor (ownership annotations, clib extern decls); a plain `pub`
  module with no anchor reads as a server endpoint and bridges over RPC
  instead. The interop manifest records who calls what.

If the native module declares app FFI (raylib-style extern decls), register
the JS implementations before the first stub call; the shim object you pass
receives `.exports`/`.mem` at instantiation for direct raw-export access:

```
import from "@jac/wasm_host" { set_na_env }

import from .arena { init }              # arena.jac (native-placed)

async def launch(shim: any, env_fns: dict) {
    set_na_env("arena", shim, {"env": env_fns});   # stem, host shim, import object
    game = await init();                           # instantiates, then calls the export
}
```

A pure-computation module needs no `set_na_env` at all. Everything below is
the raw mechanics underneath this edge - reach for it when hand-driving the
instance (hot rAF loops on `shim.exports`), or when loading a
`jac nacompile`-built module outside a Jac client app.

## One module, both halves

```jac
# main.jac
def count_primes(n: int) -> int {   # pure compute -> pin native via [placement.pins] (see jac-codespaces)
    count = 0;
    i = 2;
    while i < n {
        is_prime = True;
        j = 2;
        while j < i {
            if i % j == 0 { is_prime = False; break; }
            j += 1;
        }
        if is_prime { count += 1; }
        i += 1;
    }
    return count;
}

def:pub app -> JsxElement {
    has answer: str = "computing...";
    async can with entry {
        res: any = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(
            fetch("/static/main.wasm"), {"env": {"puts": lambda { return 0; }}}
        );
        wasm: any = res.instance.exports;
        wasm.__jac_glob_init();                        # REQUIRED before any other export
        answer = f"{wasm.count_primes(BigInt(20000))}";  # i64 param must be a BigInt
    }
    <div><p>{"primes below 20000: "}<b>{answer}</b></p></div>
}
```

```bash
jac start          # builds the client bundle AND compiles the native code to /static/main.wasm, serves :8000
jac start --dev    # same, with hot reload   (jac build emits the artifacts without serving)
```

(Serving pipeline per the project-kinds guide and the `jac/examples/raylib_shooter/web` example; the wasm module behavior below is verified by instantiating a `jac nacompile --target wasm32` build under Node.)

## The boundary is the raw wasm ABI (verified)

- **Call `wasm.__jac_glob_init()` once before using any export** - it runs the module's `glob` initializers (the native-lib auto-init has no loader equivalent in wasm, so the JS host calls it).
- **Jac `int` is i64 and crosses as `BigInt`**: `wasm.count_primes(20000)` throws `TypeError: Cannot convert 20000 to a BigInt`; pass `BigInt(20000)`, and int returns arrive as BigInt (`2262n`) - interpolate into an f-string or `Number(...)` it before arithmetic with JS numbers.
- The instantiation import object must satisfy **all** of the module's imports; only a pure-scalar module gets away with `{"env": {"puts": ...}}` (the native runtime's print hook). Anything touching collections/objects/str demands a libc-ish surface - see the next section.
- Exports = your native functions plus runtime internals (`memory`, `__heap_base`, `__jac_glob_init`, `__stack_pointer`, ...). Drive only your own functions.

## The real import surface - a tiny libc the JS host supplies (verified)

The moment a native function allocates (a `list`, a `dict`, an `obj`, str building), the module imports libc symbols. **Discover the exact set with introspection - don't guess**:

```js
const mod = new WebAssembly.Module(bytes);
console.log(WebAssembly.Module.imports(mod));   // every {module:"env", name, kind} to stub
```

Measured: a minimal list-using module demands `puts, malloc, printf, __multi3, memcpy, free, malloc_usable_size, abort`; switch to dict/str work and the set becomes `puts, printf, malloc, free, malloc_usable_size, snprintf, strlen, strcmp, memcpy, abort` - it varies per module, so introspect after each build. **Every listed import must be present or instantiation throws** (`Import #7 "env" "abort": function import requires a callable`) - including FFI externs that are dead at runtime (the shooter shim stubs its unused file functions with `lambda { return 0; }`).

A bump allocator in JS satisfies the memory surface (verified under Node - a list-building `sum_squares(BigInt(1000))` returns the correct `332833500n`):

```js
let mem, heap;
const env = {
  // Jac int args arrive as BigInt EVEN in imports: Number(n) before arithmetic.
  malloc: (n) => { const p = heap; heap = (heap + Number(n) + 7) & ~7; return p; },
  free: () => {},                       // bump allocator: never reclaims
  malloc_usable_size: () => 0,
  memcpy: (d, s, n) => { new Uint8Array(mem.buffer).copyWithin(d, s, s + Number(n)); return d; },
  puts: () => 0, printf: () => 0,
  abort: () => { throw new Error("native abort"); },
  __multi3: (res, al, ah, bl, bh) => {  // 128-bit multiply, BigInt + DataView
    const a = (BigInt.asUintN(64, ah) << 64n) | BigInt.asUintN(64, al);
    const b = (BigInt.asUintN(64, bh) << 64n) | BigInt.asUintN(64, bl);
    const p = BigInt.asUintN(128, a * b), dv = new DataView(mem.buffer);
    dv.setBigUint64(res, p & ((1n << 64n) - 1n), true);
    dv.setBigUint64(res + 8, p >> 64n, true);
  },
};
const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, { env });
mem = instance.exports.memory;
heap = instance.exports.__heap_base.value;   // seed the allocator past the module's data
instance.exports.__jac_glob_init();
```

- `str` args to an extern arrive as **pointers into linear memory** - read `new Uint8Array(mem.buffer)` from the pointer until the NUL byte (`raylib_shim.jac::_read_cstr`).
- `f64`/`f32` cross as plain JS numbers; only i64 is BigInt.
- Stdlib on this target: `math.sin` becomes an `env.sin` import (supplying `Math.sin` works, verified), `time.time` needs `clock_gettime`, while `random` is self-contained in-browser (bit-exact with CPython for the same seed). The host-binary stdlib table in `jac-native` does NOT mean "available with no imports" here.

## `import from ...` externs become wasm imports

The native module's C-FFI declarations (`import from raylib { def rlVertex3f(...); ... }`) do **not** link a library on this target - each extern becomes a **wasm import** the JS host must supply in the import object. That makes a graphics module portable: the same native source links against `libraylib.so` for a host binary, and against a JS/WebGL shim in the browser. See `jac/examples/raylib_shooter/web/` - `main.jac` holds the native game + client page, and `raylib_shim.jac` is a reusable shim that fulfills the rlgl/input/libc imports on WebGL/DOM and drives `init()`/`frame()` per requestAnimationFrame.

There is no `with entry` browser loop - export plain functions (`init`, `frame`, `get_score`) and let JS drive them: `__jac_glob_init()` once, then `init()` once, then `frame()` per `requestAnimationFrame` tick (the shim's exact sequence).

## Standalone emit (no server) - verified end to end

```bash
jac nacompile primes.jac --target wasm32 -o primes.wasm   # valid \0asm module, ~500 bytes for a small fn
```

```js
const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, { env: { puts: () => 0 } });
instance.exports.__jac_glob_init();
instance.exports.count_primes(BigInt(20000));   // -> 2262n
```

Useful for unit-testing the native half under Node, or hosting the .wasm yourself.
