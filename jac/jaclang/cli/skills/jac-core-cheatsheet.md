**Jac is strict-typed.** Every `def` parameter and return, every `has` field needs an explicit type; the escape hatch is lowercase `any` plus the `as` cast - full rules, narrowing patterns, and error codes in `jac-types`. Syntax-wise: Python-flavored, every statement ends with `;`, every block is `{ }`-braced - **except `match`/`case` bodies, which use Python indentation** (see below). One deliberate `;` exception: the final expression of a `def`/ability/lambda body may drop its `;` to become the **implicit return** value (Rust-style tail expression); anywhere else a missing `;` is an error (`E2084`/`E0002`). Top-level code runs inside `with entry { ... }`.

```jac
import os;
import from math { pi }


def double(x: int) -> int {
    return x * 2;
}

def triple(x: int) -> int {
    x * 3    # implicit return: final expression without ';' is the return value
}


with entry {
    name: str = "alice";
    age: int = 30;
    tags: list[str] = ["a", "b"];
    manager: str | None = None;

    doubled: list[int] = [n * 2 for n in [1, 2, 3]];
    label: str = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor";   # ternary: A if cond else B

    inc = lambda (x: int) { x + 1; };                    # typed lambda, implicit return
    square = lambda (x: int) -> int { return x * x; };   # optional return type, explicit return
    print(inc(4), square(5));

    greeting = f"hello {name}, {len(tags)} tags";
    print(greeting, label, manager);

    for n in doubled {
        if n > 4 { print(f"big: {n}"); }
        elif n > 2 { print(f"mid: {n}"); }
        else { print(f"small: {n}"); }
    }

    try {
        _ = int("not-a-number");      # discard with `_` - unread names warn W2003
    } except ValueError as e {
        print(f"parse error: {str(e)}");
    }
}
```

## Match statements - the ONE indentation-sensitive construct

`case` arms take a **colon + indented body**, NOT braces. `case 0 { ... }` is a parse error (E0001 `Expected ':', got '{'`). Guards (`case x if cond:`) and destructuring work as in Python:

```jac
obj Point { has x: int = 0; has y: int = 0; }

def describe(value: any) -> str {
    match value {
        case 0:
            return "zero";
        case int() as n if n < 0:           # guard clause
            return f"negative: {n}";
        case [x, y]:                        # sequence destructure
            return f"pair: {x}, {y}";
        case {"kind": k}:                   # dict pattern
            return f"kind={k}";
        case Point(x=px, y=py):             # class pattern
            return f"point {px},{py}";
        case _:
            return "other";
    }
}
```

There is also a C-style `switch value { case 1: ... default: ... }` - it **falls through** like C; end each case with `break;`.

## Globals and entry points

```jac
glob counter: int = 0;          # module-level variable - `glob`, not bare assignment

def increment {
    counter += 1;               # assigns the glob directly - no `global` statement
}

with entry { print("runs on EVERY import of this module"); }
with entry:__main__ { increment(); }   # only when run directly (= Python __main__)
```

**Scoping - there is no `global` or `nonlocal` statement.** A bare assignment (including `+=`) inside a function assigns to the nearest *enclosing* binding - an enclosing function's local, or a `glob`-declared module variable; a new local is created only when no such binding exists. (Python's classic gotcha - `x += 1` on a global raising `UnboundLocalError` - doesn't exist.) To *shadow* an outer binding instead, write a typed declaration (`x: int = 5;`) before any use or assignment of that name in the scope; a typed declaration after the name has already been rebound there is an error (E0064). Loop targets, `except ... as`, and `with ... as` targets always bind fresh locals. Only `glob`-declared module variables are implicitly rebindable - assigning the name of an import, function, or class creates a local.

**Pitfall for importable libraries:** plain `with entry` executes every time the module is imported. Put demo/CLI code in `with entry:__main__` or importing your module will run it.

## Import forms

**Plain `.jac` file imports:**

```
import os;                              # module - takes `;`
import numpy as np;                     # aliased - full PyPI access (see jac-python-interop)
import from jaclang.byllm.lib { Model }         # selective - NO `;`
import type from billing { Invoice }    # annotation-only - breaks circular imports (see jac-types)
import ".styles/global.css";            # file - takes `;`
```

**Client imports (in code inferred client - it carries JSX or an npm import):**

```
import from .button { Button }                        # relative (dots)
import from "@jac/runtime" { Router, Routes, Route }  # npm (quoted)
```

**Codespaces are inferred - there is no placement syntax.** JSX and string-path npm imports mark a declaration client, and the helpers/`glob`s/imports client code references join the client bundle (scope-aware propagation, across modules); python imports and graph archetypes anchor code server, which is also the default; `def:pub` endpoints and walkers in server-anchored modules stay server (client calls become auto-RPC); extern C-decl imports (`import from lib { def f(x: f64) -> f64; }`) mark a declaration native and its users follow (consuming a native module is not a signal; a whole anchor-free module compiles native under the default codespace when it can lower, else server with a note; pure code in mixed modules stays server). Overrides live in `jac.toml`: `[placement.pins] "mod.name" = "server"` pins a declaration server-side (or `"client"`/`"native"`). See `jac-codespaces`.

**`main.jac` mixes both sides.** Server imports go at the top (server is the default placement). The client section - CSS import, top-level component, `def:pub app` (no-arg for manual routing; `app(children)` that renders `children` for file-based routing - see `jac-cl-routing`) - is inferred client from its JSX and string-path imports; no wrapper syntax exists or is needed.

**No-dot imports are project-root absolute.** In server/native code, `import from engine.math.vec3 { Vec3 }` resolves against the **project root** (the nearest `jac.toml` dir) from *anywhere* in the project - the importing file may sit at the root, under `tests/`, or any depth, and the import is identical. This is the idiomatic form; prefer it over dot-counting. A test in `tests/` imports the modules it exercises with the same no-dot path it would use at the root.

**Relative (dotted) imports** walk up from the importing file's own directory - each leading `.` is one folder. They are mainly needed in **client** code (inferred client from JSX or npm imports), where the bundler resolves them. Imports of server modules from client code carry the same dot semantics.

| Dots | Meaning | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `shared.X`     | project-root absolute  | **default** - resolves from any depth in the project (server/native) |
| `.store`       | same folder            | `store` is a sibling module in this same folder |
| `..shared.X`   | one folder up          | importing file is one level deep (`recipes/X.jac`) |
| `...shared.X`  | two folders up         | importing file is two levels deep (`recipes/parts/X.jac`) |

A no-dot import is depth-independent: moving a file between directories never changes it. Dot-counted forms (`..`, `...`) DO break when a file moves to a different depth - wrong dot count = silent resolution failure = imported names become `<Unknown>` → cascading type errors.

**Server modules should prefer the no-dot form, and a `..` that climbs out of a package is a bug waiting to happen.** `import from ..shared.github { fetch }` resolves fine under `jac start` but fails `jac test <file>` with `attempted relative import beyond top-level package`, because the test runner roots the package at the target file's own directory. `import from shared.github { fetch }` works in both. Client modules keep the dotted form - that is what the bundler resolves.

## Also available (Python semantics, brace bodies)

Generators (`yield` / `yield from`), decorators (`@deco` above `def`), walrus `(n := len(items))`, context managers (`with open(f) as fh { ... }`), C-style loops `for i = 0 while i < 10 with i += 1 { }`, null-safe access `user?.profile?.name`, `cfg?["key"]` (returns `None` instead of raising - even for missing keys/out-of-range indices), and the default idiom `name = user?.name or "Anonymous";`.

## Pitfalls

- **Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable or parameter names** - declaration words (`node`, `edge`, `walker`, `obj`, `def`, `impl`), OSP / control words (`visit`, `disengage`, `report`, `spawn`, `flow`, `wait`, `skip`, `del`), module words (`include`), and `with`, `can`, `has`. (`entry` and `exit` are *not* reserved - fine as identifiers.) Escape with a single **leading** backtick: `` `visit `` (no closing backtick; `` `visit` `` is a lexer error).
- **Python reserved words can't name `has` fields or parameters - even backtick-escaped.** `` has `class: str; `` fails `jac check` with **E0067**: the generated Python uses the name as a real identifier, so escaping can't help. Pick a non-reserved name (`kind`, `cls`). Jac-only keywords that aren't Python keywords (`visit`, `node`, ...) escape fine everywhere.
- **`` `any `` vs `any`:** bare `any` is the gradual *type*; backticked `` `any(...) `` calls the builtin truthiness *function*.
- `import from X { Y };` fails with E0030. **Brace imports take NO trailing semicolon.** Plain module form `import X;` does.
- **There is no `pass` statement** (`E0010`). For an intentionally empty block write empty braces: `{}`.
- **Tuple unpacking in `for` needs parens.** `for (k, v) in d.items() { ... }` works; the Python spelling `for k, v in d.items()` is a parse error. Same in comprehensions.
- **Unused names warn (`W2003`).** Prefix intentionally-unused names with `_`, or for unread exception bindings drop the clause: `except ValueError { ... }`, not `except ValueError as e`. A value bound only to *validate* still counts as unused - discard with `_ = int(s);`. This is the #1 reason otherwise-correct parsing/validation code fails `jac check`.
- **Booleans are `True`/`False`, null is `None` - capitalized.** Lowercase `false` parses as an undefined name, so `return false;` fails with the *misleading* `E1002: Cannot return <Unknown>, expected bool`.
- **Docstrings go immediately before a declaration, never inside its body** (`W0060`, often + `E0002`).
- **Lambdas have ONE form: `lambda (params) { body }`.** Params always parenthesized and annotated - zero-arg `lambda { onSign(); }`, single param `lambda (v: str) { gbName = v; }` (in client code also `lambda (e: ChangeEvent) { ... }`), multi-param `lambda (exports: any, fps: int) { ... }` - with an optional return type: `lambda (x: int) -> int { return x * x; }`. A body that is exactly one expression statement IS the implicit return (`lambda (x: int) { x + 1; }` returns `x + 1`); multi-statement bodies need an explicit `return ...;` or a semicolon-less tail expression (`lambda (x: int) { y = x + 1; y * 10 }` returns `y * 10`), otherwise the lambda returns `None` (fine for event handlers). A param annotation may be omitted only where the type is inferable from context; otherwise it's E1119. The Python colon forms (`lambda x: x`, `lambda x: int : x + 1`) and any paren-less form that carries a parameter (`lambda x { ... }`, `lambda v: str { ... }`) are parse errors - only a zero-parameter lambda may drop the parens (`lambda { ... }`).
- Ternary is **Python-style**: `A if cond else B`. NOT `cond ? A : B` - parse error.
- Boolean operators are **`and`/`or`/`not`** - C-style `&&`/`||` do not exist (parse error).
- **Python stdlib needs explicit import - Jac auto-imports nothing.** `datetime.now()` without `import from datetime { datetime }` = runtime `NameError`.
- **Client calls to server functions are `async` - always `await` them.** `items = fetch_items()` assigns a `Promise`, not the data.
- **`import:py` does not exist** - LLMs hallucinate it; use `import json;` / `import from datetime { datetime }`.
- **Enums use Jac form, NOT Python `class X(Enum)`.** Write `enum Color { RED, GREEN }`. When members must BE `int`/`str` instances (JSON, wire formats), use typed-base `enum HttpStatus: int { OK = 200 }` (desugars to `IntEnum`) or `enum Tag: str { OPEN = "open" }` (`StrEnum`) - then **do NOT add `.value`**, members already are the base type.
- Concatenating a string with an Exception fails - wrap with `str(e)`.
