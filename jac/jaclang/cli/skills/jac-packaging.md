description: Packaging a Jac project as a wheel and publishing it to PyPI, and npm packages via `jac bundle --target npm` - jac.toml metadata, the package-directory layout, console-script and plugin entry points, extras, precompiled bytecode, twine/npm upload. Load when turning a project into a pip-installable CLI tool, an importable library, a Jac plugin, or an npm component library. Pair with `jac-scaffold` (creating the project) and `jac-impl-files` (source layout).

`jac bundle` builds a standard PEP 427 wheel plus an sdist (`dist/<name>-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`, `dist/<name>-<version>.tar.gz`) straight from `jac.toml` - no `setup.py`, no `pyproject.toml`. Upload with `twine`. `jac bundle --target npm` builds an npm tarball from the same `jac.toml`. This covers three shapes: a **CLI tool** (installs a terminal command), an **importable library** (`pip install` then `import`), and an **npm component library**.

## The package directory - REQUIRED

`jac bundle` packages a directory whose name matches `project.name` (hyphens become underscores: `my-tool` -> `my_tool/`). The `jac create` default template puts `main.jac` at the project ROOT with no such directory - that layout does NOT produce an importable package. Create the package dir yourself:

```
greet/                  <- project root (holds jac.toml)
  jac.toml
  README.md
  greet/                <- package dir, name matches project.name
    cli.jac             <- your code, normal Jac
```

**A single top-level `.jac`/`.py` file is never collected** - `packages` matches directories only. A directory containing just `__init__.jac` is enough.

## jac.toml for distribution

```toml
[project]
name = "greet"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A tiny Jac CLI app"
authors = [{name = "Jane Dev", email = "jane@example.com"}]
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
license = "MIT"
keywords = ["cli", "greeting"]
classifiers = [
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
  "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://example.com/greet"

[entrypoints.scripts]
greet = "greet.cli:main"

[dependencies]
jaclang = ">=0.16.0"
rich = ">=13.0.0"

[optional-dependencies.data]
pymongo = ">=4.0,<5.0"
```

- **`[project]`** -> wheel `METADATA`. The TOML key is **`requires-python`** (hyphen), not `requires_python` - the underscore form is silently ignored and never reaches `METADATA`.
- **`classifiers` must be a TOML array** (`[...]`). A plain string is a TOML type error and produces malformed wheel metadata.
- **`[dependencies]`** -> `Requires-Dist` in the wheel, so `pip install` pulls them in. **`jaclang` is NOT auto-added - list it explicitly** or consumers can't import your `.jac` modules (the importer it ships is what runs your code). `[dev-dependencies]` ship as a `dev` extra, not as runtime requirements.
- **`[optional-dependencies.<group>]`** -> wheel extras: consumers `pip install greet[data]`; during development `jac install --extras data`.
- **`[entrypoints.scripts]`** -> `console_scripts` in `entry_points.txt`. Format is `command = "package.module:function"`. The function is called with no arguments; read `sys.argv` for CLI args. Omit this whole section for a pure library.
- **`[entrypoints.jac]`** -> the `jac` entry-point group: declares a **Jac plugin** auto-discovered at startup (`mylib = "mylib.plugin:JacRuntime"`). Use this when publishing a plugin that extends the `jac` CLI/runtime.

## Build and publish

```
jac bundle                       # -> dist/greet-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl + .tar.gz sdist
jac bundle -o /tmp/wheels        # custom output dir
jac bundle --precompile          # also compile .jac -> .jir bytecode (see below)
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*   # TestPyPI first - verify the listing renders
twine upload dist/*              # then the real index
```

There is no `jac publish` command - use `twine` (separate pip install). In CI authenticate with a token: `twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p "$PYPI_TOKEN"`. Consumers then `pip install greet`; the CLI command `greet` is on `PATH`, or `import greet` works for a library.

`--precompile` / `-p` creates an isolated venv per `python3.X` on `PATH`, compiles all `.jac` to `.jir` bytecode, and folds it into the wheel - consumers skip first-import compilation. Shipped bytecode is keyed by Python version and source hash; if missing/stale the runtime transparently falls back to compiling the bundled `.jac` source, so a mismatch never breaks the package.

## Publishing to npm

`jac bundle --target npm` compiles client modules (`.cl.jac` and plain `.jac` under the package dir) to ES-module JavaScript, generates `package.json` + a `.d.ts` per module (TypeScript consumers get full type-checking), and packs `dist/<name>-<version>.tgz`. `--target all` builds wheel + npm in one go.

```toml
[npm]
name = "@yourscope/greetui"     # scoped npm name (defaults to normalized project name)
entry = "greetui/index.cl.jac"  # entry module (defaults to an index.* module)
```

- Modules that use JSX or the reactive API automatically get `@jaseci/runtime` wired into `dependencies` (a normal, React-independent npm package). Modules that explicitly `import from react` get `react`/`react-dom` as `peerDependencies`. (Maintainers build the runtime itself with `--target npm-runtime`.)
- **sv-boundary rejection**: a module with an `sv` import/call cannot run from a plain `npm install`, so the build fails with `'<file>' crosses a server boundary and cannot be published as a standalone npm package. npm packages must be pure client code`. Keep server-coupled code in your app, not the library.
- `jac` builds the tarball only - upload with `npm publish dist/<name>-<version>.tgz --access public` (CI: `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`).

## What lands in the wheel

`jac bundle` collects `*.jac`, `*.py`, `*.pyi`, `*.lark`, `py.typed`, and `*.jir` from the package directory. It excludes `.jac/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `venv/.venv/env/`, `.git/`, and `node_modules/`. To package extra directories or override patterns, use `[project.include]` with `packages` and `data` keys.

## Editable installs (local development)

```
jac install -e .            # install the current project editable
jac install -e /path/to/lib # install a cloned library editable
```

## Pitfalls

- **No package directory = empty/unimportable wheel.** The `default` scaffold's root-level `main.jac` is for `jac run`, not for distribution. Move code into a `<name>/` package dir (single top-level files are not collected).
- **Forgetting `jaclang` in `[dependencies]`** ships a wheel whose `.jac` modules fail to import in a clean environment. It is not added for you.
- **`requires_python` (underscore) is dropped.** Use `requires-python`. Same hyphen-vs-underscore trap does NOT apply to `classifiers` - there the trap is string-vs-array.
- **Entry-point path is the install-time module path**, e.g. `greet.cli:main` - it must match the package dir name, not the source folder you happened to develop in.
- **First run of an installed Jac command prints `Jac setup complete! (N modules compiled and cached)`** while jaclang compiles its own cache. One-time and harmless (avoid by shipping `--precompile` bytecode).
- **`jac bundle` fails with `[project] name is missing`** if `jac.toml` has no `name` - it is required for the wheel filename and `.dist-info`.
