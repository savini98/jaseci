# Import Anything

Jac compiles one source file to **three targets** -- Python bytecode, JavaScript, and native machine code. Each target is a *codespace*, and each codespace brings its own ecosystem:

| Codespace | Compiles to | Ecosystem you can import |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Server** | Python bytecode | The entire **PyPI** ecosystem + any `.py` / `.jac` module |
| **Client** | JavaScript | The entire **npm** ecosystem + any `.jac` client module |
| **Native** | Machine code (LLVM) | Any **C-ABI** shared library + native `.jac` modules |

There is exactly **one `import` statement**. Its shape never changes -- the *codespace it lands in* decides which ecosystem the name resolves against. This page walks through every import form, contextualized for each codespace.

---

## The one import statement

Every import follows the same template. Square brackets mark optional parts:

```text
[import|include]  [type]  [from <path>]  [{ items }]  [;]
```

- **`import`** brings names in; **`include`** absorbs *all* of a module's names into the current namespace (like Python's `from x import *`).
- **`type`** marks the import as annotation-only -- it is erased at runtime (lowers to `TYPING.TYPE_CHECKING`). Use it to break circular imports.
- **`from <path>`** selects the source module. A `<path>` is either a dotted name (`os.path`), a leading-dot relative path (`.utils`, `..lib`), or a quoted string (`"react-dom"`, `"libm.so"`).
- **`{ items }`** is the import list. Items can be plain names, `name as alias`, `* as alias`, `default as alias`, or -- for C libraries -- whole declarations.

A plain whole-module import (`import os;`) takes a trailing semicolon. The `import from ... { ... }` brace form does not.

---

## Choosing the codespace

Most of the time the codespace is chosen *for* you. An import inherits the codespace of its surrounding context, and that context is usually inferred:

- A **quoted npm path** (`import from "react-dom" { render }`) is client-only by construction, so it lands in the client codespace automatically -- and the declarations that use it become client too.
- A **bare-name npm import** (`import from react { useState }`) is placed through its consumers: when JSX components use the imported names, the import joins the client bundle with them.
- **Python / PyPI imports** are server code -- the default for anything unmarked.
- An **extern-decl C import** -- braces containing C-ABI function declarations (`import from "libm.so" { def sqrt(x: f64) -> f64; }`) -- can only be satisfied by the native backend, so it lands in the native codespace automatically, and the declarations that use it become native too. Merely importing *from* a native module is not a native signal for the importer. (Whole markerless modules are a separate question: under the default native codespace, the placement solver compiles a module native whenever its import closure can lower -- see the codespace model.)

When inference must be overridden, the mechanism is a `[placement.pins]` entry in `jac.toml` -- placement has no spelling in the source. The inference rules and their precedence are specified once in [Primitives & Codespace Semantics](language/primitives.md#codespace-model); this page assumes them and covers what is specific to imports.

## Server imports -- full PyPI compatibility

Server code compiles to standard Python bytecode and runs on the Python runtime, so **every package on PyPI works unmodified** -- no wrappers, no interop layer. The server codespace is the default, so the examples below need no annotation of any kind.

```jac
"""Server imports -- the default codespace."""

# Whole-module import
import os;
import os.path;

# Whole-module with alias
import numpy as np;

# Several modules in one statement
import os, sys, json;

# Named imports from a module
import from math { sqrt, pi }

# Named imports with aliases
import from collections { OrderedDict as ODict, defaultdict }

# Deep PyPI package paths work like any Python "from ... import"
import from sklearn.linear_model { LinearRegression }

with entry {
    print(sqrt(pi));
}
```

Importing your own Jac and Python modules uses the *same* syntax -- a `.jac` file and a `.py` file are interchangeable as import targets:

```jac
# Relative imports -- Jac uses leading dots, like Python
import from .utils { helper }            # sibling module
import from ..lib.helpers { format_date }  # parent package
import from ...config { settings }        # grandparent package

# Import a whole local module (.jac or .py -- resolved automatically)
import models;
import from models { Task }
```

!!! note "No-dot imports anchor to the project root"
    A dotted, no-leading-dot import (`import models;`, `import from engine.math.vec3 { Vec3 }`) resolves against the **project root** -- the nearest directory with a `jac.toml` -- from anywhere in the project. The importing file's depth does not matter, so a test under `tests/` uses the exact same path as a file at the root, and moving a file between directories never changes its imports.

!!! note "Relative imports follow package rules"
    Just like Python, `.` / `..` / `...` resolve relative to the *package* a module belongs to. A `..` import only works when a real parent package sits above the current module. A file run directly with `jac run` is treated as a top-level script, so `..`-style imports *inside that entry file* fail with *"relative import beyond top-level package."* Use relative imports between modules inside nested package directories; from an entry script, reach other modules by their absolute path.

Two server-only forms round out the set:

```jac
# Type-only import -- erased at runtime, lowers to TYPE_CHECKING.
# Use it to break circular imports between modules.
import type from typing { Protocol }
import type from .models { Task }

# include -- absorbs every public name from the module into this namespace.
include math_helpers;
```

!!! note "Inline Python escape hatch"
    For Python-only APIs or legacy code, you can embed raw Python in a `::py:: ... ::py::` block instead of importing. Prefer a normal `import` for anything new.

## Client imports -- full npm compatibility

Client code compiles to JavaScript, so the import list maps directly onto ECMAScript `import` declarations -- giving you **the entire npm ecosystem**. Client imports live in the client codespace, but that rarely needs marking: a quoted npm path is client by construction, and a bare-name npm import is inferred client through the JSX components that use it. The examples below are plain `.jac` -- in a mixed file, the components that use these names carry them into the client bundle.

```jac
# Named imports -- the most common form
import from react { useState, useEffect }

# Named imports with aliases
import from lodash { map as mapArray, filter }

# Default import -- "default as Name". Requires the client codespace,
# because Python has no concept of a default export.
import from react { default as React }

# Namespace import -- "* as Name"
import from react { * as React }

# Mixed: default + named in one statement (default listed first)
import from react { default as React, useRef }
```

npm package names often contain hyphens or `@scope/` prefixes that are not valid Jac identifiers. Quote them as **string literals** -- this works for every import form:

```jac
import from "react-dom" { render, hydrate }
import from "react-router-dom" { BrowserRouter, Route }
import from "styled-components" { default as styled }
import from "date-fns" { * as DateFns }

# @jac/runtime -- built-in client runtime helpers
import from "@jac/runtime" { Link, useNavigate, JacForm }
```

Relative client modules and configured path aliases:

```jac
# Relative imports between .jac client modules
import from .components.Button { default as Button }
import from ..lib.helpers { formatDate }

# Path aliases -- prefixes defined in jac.toml under [client.paths]
import from "@components/Button" { default as Button }
import from "@shared" { constants }
```

A path alias is declared once in `jac.toml`:

```toml
[client.paths]
"@components/*" = "./components/*"
"@shared" = "./shared/index"
```

### Side-effect imports & stylesheets

Some imports bind no names -- they exist purely for their side effects. **Stylesheets are the most common case:** importing a `.css` or `.scss` file applies its styles to the bundle. Drop the `{ items }` list entirely and import the path as a bare string literal:

```jac
# Stylesheets -- applied to the bundle, no names bound
import "./styles.css";
import "./theme.scss";

# A font package whose CSS you want applied globally
import "@fontsource/roboto/400.css";

# A polyfill or any import-for-its-effects-only package
import "core-js/stable";
```

Each lowers to a side-effect-only ECMAScript import -- `import "./styles.css";` stays `import "./styles.css";` in the generated JavaScript. Asset files (`.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less`, `.svg`, images, fonts) are detected by the client bundler and emitted into the built `styles.css` / asset output automatically.

---

## Native imports -- full C-ABI compatibility

Native code compiles to machine code through LLVM. It has no Python interpreter, so PyPI packages are unavailable -- instead, the native codespace can call into **any C-ABI shared library** and import other native Jac modules.

```jac
# Import from another native Jac module
import from math_utils { square, cube }

# A small slice of the standard library is available natively
import sys;   # sys.argv, sys.exit()
```

The headline native feature is **C library interop**. Point `import from` at a shared library path and declare the foreign functions you need right inside the braces -- the compiler generates the C-ABI bridge. An extern-decl import like this is also the *native signal*: it seeds native placement for itself and the declarations that use it -- nothing else marks the boundary:

```jac
# Pull a math function out of libm
import from "/usr/lib/libm.so.6" {
    def sqrt(x: f64) -> f64;
}

# C signatures use fixed-width types -- carry those types through code
# that feeds values into the C call.
def hypotenuse(a: f64, b: f64) -> f64 {
    return sqrt(a * a + b * b);
}
```

The same mechanism works for any third-party C library, and a C `import from` block can declare structs (as `obj`) alongside functions:

```jac
import from "libgeometry.so" {
    obj Point { has x: f64; has y: f64; }
    def make_point(x: f64, y: f64) -> Point;
    def distance(a: Point, b: Point) -> f64;
}
```

!!! info "Fixed-width types at the C boundary"
    The `import from` declaration uses fixed-width types (`f64`, `i32`, `u8`, `c_void`, …) so the signature matches the C ABI exactly. Carry those same fixed-width types through any function that passes values into a C call -- the native backend coerces, but mixing plain `float`/`int` with `f64`/`i32` at a call site is best avoided. Library paths are platform-specific -- `.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS, and system libraries live in different locations per platform.

---

## Crossing codespaces

A single file can mix all three codespaces, and imports can reach *across* the boundary. Placement is inferred: importing a server walker or `def:pub` function into client code is just a plain import, and the compiler rewrites each call into an HTTP request automatically. A server-to-server microservice boundary is declared in config instead -- list the provider module in `[scale.microservices.routes]` and imports of it lower to service RPC stubs.

```jac
# Import a server walker into client code -- calls become HTTP requests.
import from .main { create_task }

import from react { useState }

    def TaskForm() -> JsxElement {
        has title: str = "";
        <button onClick={lambda (e: ChangeEvent) {
            create_task(title=title);
        }}>Add</button>
    }
```

Server and native code interoperate the same way -- a native-placed function can be called directly from server code in the same file, with the compiler generating the interop stubs:

```jac
"""One file, three codespaces."""

# Server is the default -- no header needed at the top.
import from datetime { datetime }

def now_iso() -> str {
    return datetime.now().isoformat();
}

def fib(n: int) -> int {
    if n <= 1 { return n; }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

with entry {
    print(now_iso());
    print(fib(10));   # native function called from the server codespace
}
```

| Path alias | `import from "@shared" { c }` | cl |
| C library function | `import from "libm.so" { def sqrt(x: f64) -> f64; }` | na |
| Server walker into client | `import from .main { walker }` (bridged over HTTP) | cl |

## Validating your imports

Syntax-check any snippet before running it -- the Jac compiler parses imports without resolving them, so this catches mistakes fast:

```bash
jac check --parse-only myfile.jac   # syntax only -- works for sv, cl, and na
jac check myfile.jac                # full type-check (server / client code)
```

`--parse-only` is the universally safe check for all three codespaces. For **native (`na`) code that calls C libraries**, the most reliable verification is to compile it -- `jac run myfile.jac` or `jac nacompile myfile.jac` -- since the native backend, not the general type checker, owns C-ABI coercion.

If you have the [`jac mcp`](mcp.md) server connected, the `check_syntax` and `validate_jac` tools do the same thing from your AI assistant.
