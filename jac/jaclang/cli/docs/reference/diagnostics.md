# Errors and Warnings

The Jac compiler uses a structured diagnostic code system. Every error, warning, and note has a unique code that identifies the issue and can be used for inline suppression.

## Code Format

Diagnostic codes follow the pattern `{severity}{category}{sequence}`:

- **Severity**: `E` (error) or `W` (warning)
- **Category digit**: `0` = syntax, `1` = type, `2` = semantic, `3` = lint, `4` = import, `5` = codegen, `9` = internal
- **Sequence**: Three-digit number within the category

For example, `E1030` is a **type error** about attribute access, and `W3005` is a **lint warning** about empty parentheses.

## Guide Pointers

When a diagnostic maps to a topic covered by the bundled reference guides, `jac check` prints a one-line pointer beneath it:

```text
error[E1001]: Cannot assign Literal["hello"] to int
  --> example.jac:2:5
  → run 'jac guide jac-types' for guidance
```

Run the suggested command for the relevant reference material. See [`jac guide`](cli/index.md#jac-guide).

## Suppressing Diagnostics

### Inline Suppression

Add a `# jac:ignore[CODE]` comment on the same line as the diagnostic to suppress it:

<!-- jac-skip -->
```jac
x = some_func();  # jac:ignore[E1030]
```

Multiple codes can be suppressed on the same line:

<!-- jac-skip -->
```jac
x = some_func();  # jac:ignore[E1030,W2001]
```

### Project-Level Suppression

Use `jac.toml` to suppress diagnostics project-wide. See the [Configuration](config/index.md#checklint) reference for lint rule configuration.

### CLI Flags

- `--nowarn` on `jac check` suppresses all warnings (errors are still shown)
- `-e` / `--diagnostics` on `jac run` controls diagnostic verbosity: `error` (default -- report error-level diagnostics with full detail), `all` (errors + warnings), or `none` (silent). This flag governs *what is printed*, not whether the program runs. `jac run` still executes -- and exits `0` -- when the type checker finds errors: for example, `x: int = "no";` reports `E1001` under `jac check` but runs anyway under `jac run`. Only errors that stop the compiler from producing runnable code (parse/lex and codegen errors, such as a missing `;`) abort a run. To gate on type errors, use `jac check`, which exits non-zero

## Type Errors (E1xxx)

Emitted by the type checker and type evaluator.

### Assignment / Return Mismatches

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E1001` | Cannot assign {actual} to {expected} |
| `E1002` | Cannot return {actual}, expected {expected} |
| `E1003` | Return type annotation required when function returns a value |
| `E1004` | Function '{name}' declared return type {ret_type} but may implicitly return None |

!!! tip "`E1001`/`E1002` with `any` on the right-hand side"
    A common trigger for `E1001` and `E1002` is Jac's strict gradual-typing rule: in `.jac` source, an `any` value cannot silently flow into a declared non-`any`, non-`object` destination. Ways to clear it -- type the source (e.g. `has reports: list[T]` on a walker, `.pyi` stub on a Python utility), drop the annotation (`x = src()` makes `x` inferred-`any`), annotate `any` explicitly (`x: any = src()`) and narrow before downstream use, or re-type at the use site with the [`as` cast](language/operators.md#10-the-as-cast-operator) (`src() as list[T]`) when you know more than the checker. See [The `any` Type and Gradual Typing](language/types-and-values.md#the-any-type-and-gradual-typing).

|------|---------|
| `E1060` | TypeVar "{name}" must be assigned to a simple variable |
| `E1061` | TypeVar name "{name}" must match the assigned variable name "{var}" |
| `E1062` | TypeVar "{name}" is already in use by an outer scope |
| `E1063` | TypeVar() requires a string literal as the first argument |
| `E1064` | TypeVar requires at least two constrained types |
| `E1065` | Type variable "{name}" has no meaning in this context |

| `E1098` | Connection type must be an edge instance |
| `E1099` | Cannot access attribute "{attr}" for type "{type}"; attribute is missing from {missing} |

### mobUI-Project JSX Host Tags

Emitted by `JsxIntrinsicGuardPass` when a `mobui` project (see [React Native target](plugins/jac-client.md#react-native-target-beta)) uses a raw HTML host tag in JSX. The guard resolves every tag name in the enclosing scope; only **unresolved lowercase names** are treated as HTML host elements and rejected. Uppercase components and lowercase components that resolve to an in-scope symbol are allowed. `.jac` web-boundary files (but not `.native.jac` files, which target React Native) and modules outside the project root are exempt; the client kind is discovered from each module's own project `jac.toml`, never the process cwd.

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E1105` | JSX tag '<{tag}>' is not in scope in a mobUI project; use {suggestion} instead |

!!! tip "Fixing `E1105`"
    `E1105` fires only in `mobui` projects (`[project] client_kind = "mobui"` in `jac.toml`). Replace the HTML tag with the suggested `@jac/mobui` primitive: `div`/`section`/`main` -> `View`, `span`/`p`/`h1`-`h6` -> `Text`, `button` -> `Pressable`, `input`/`textarea` -> `TextInput`, `img` -> `Image`, `ul`/`ol` -> `ScrollView`. If the lowercase name is meant to be a component, import it so it resolves in scope. Web projects (`client_kind` unset) are unaffected -- HTML tags remain valid there.

### Ownership / Borrow Errors

Emitted by `OwnershipCheckPass` for `own`/`imm`/`borrow`/`&`/`&mut` bindings and `in <handle> { }` region opens. See [Ownership & Borrowing](language/ownership-borrowing.md). On the native pathway the checker is one of the required analyses: it always runs there, and error-severity findings block native codegen -- a clean check is what makes the annotations trustworthy facts for lowering (see the [Ownership Fact Schema](../internals/ownership-checker-spec.md)). Whether diagnostics are *displayed* never changes generated code; builds with and without display are bit-identical.

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E1301` | Use of '{name}' after it was moved |
| `E1302` | Conflicting mutable borrow of '{name}' while another borrow is live |
| `E1303` | Cannot mutate '{name}' while a shared borrow of it is live |
| `E1304` | '{name}' is destroyed while still borrowed |
| `E1305` | *Reserved, not yet registered* -- will be "Linear resource '{name}' is never consumed" once the planned `linear` marker lands (a `linear` binding must be moved exactly once; plain `own` is affine and may be silently dropped) |
| `E1306` | Borrow of '{name}' escapes its scope |
| `E1307` | Reference to '{name}' escapes its region |
| `E1308` | '{name}' is not sendable across a concurrency boundary |
| `E1309` | Cannot mutate '{name}' through a deep-immutable `imm` binding |
| `E1311` | Cannot freeze '{name}': the value may be aliased |
| `E1313` | `flow for` does not allow {name} |

### Zero-RC Enforcement Errors

Emitted by `OwnershipCheckPass` only in **nogc-enforced** native modules (`jac nacompile --enforce-nogc`, or a module matching a `jac.toml [gc.enforce]` pattern -- see [Zero-RC ownership compilation](language/native-pathway.md#zero-rc-ownership-compilation)). They make zero-RC ownership coverage a compile-time contract: every heap-typed contract position must be in the owned world, and each violation is a hard error that blocks native codegen. The `{provenance}` in every message states why the module is enforced (the CLI flag or the matching config pattern).

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E1401` | Heap-typed {position} '{name}' has no ownership state in a nogc-enforced module ({provenance}) |
| `E1402` | Owned value '{name}' is sealed into managed storage inside a nogc-enforced module ({provenance}) |
| `E1403` | Heap value '{name}' crosses implicitly out of a nogc-enforced module ({provenance}) |
| `E1404` | '{name}' is `any`-typed and could be heap-allocated in a nogc-enforced module ({provenance}) |
| `E1405` | Closure capture of '{name}' escapes its scope in a nogc-enforced module ({provenance}) |
| `E1406` | '{name}' has retaining or aliasing semantics not supported in a nogc-enforced module ({provenance}) |

### Type Warnings

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `W1036` | Generic type "{type}" used without type arguments, defaulting to "{type}[Any]"; consider adding explicit type arguments |
| `W1037` | Explicit 'any' type annotation disables type checking here; consider a more specific type |
| `W1050` | Unknown intrinsic JSX element '<{tag}>' |
| `W1051` | Expression type could not be resolved (Unknown) |
| `W1052` | JSX component '{component}' uses an untyped props bag (`props: any`); its JSX props cannot be type-checked |
| `W1310` | Region open on '{name}' has an empty body |
| `W1312` | Owned value '{name}' silently seals into managed storage |

---

## Import Warnings (W1xxx)

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `W1100` | Module not found |
| `W1101` | Cannot import name '{name}' from module '{module}' |
| `W1102` | Imported name '{name}' from foreign-source module '{module}' typed as Any |
| `E1120` | Import of '{name}' from untyped external module '{module}' (no type declarations found) |
| `W1103` | '{name}' is ambient and does not need to be imported from '{module}' |
| `W1104` | Use the lowercase `any` keyword instead of importing `Any` from typing |
| `W1105` | Local module '{name}' shadows the npm package of the same name |

---

## Semantic Errors (E2xxx / W2xxx)

Emitted by static analysis and declaration-implementation matching passes.

### Static Analysis

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `W2001` | Name '{name}' may be undefined |
| `W2002` | Unreachable code detected |
| `W2003` | '{name}' is defined but never used |

### Semantic Errors

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E2004` | Non default attribute '{name}' follows default attribute |
| `E2005` | Missing "postinit" method required by uninitialized attribute(s) |
| `W2006` | '@classmethod' decorator is not recommended in '{kind}' definitions |
| `W2007` | '@staticmethod' is not supported in '{kind}' definitions |
| `E2008` | Invalid target for context update: {target} |
| `W2029` | '@{decorator}' is not recommended in '{kind}' definitions -- use native property syntax |

`W2029` covers the Python property decorators -- `@property`, and the same-object
`@x.getter` / `@x.setter` / `@x.deleter` -- in favour of [native property
syntax](language/functions-objects.md#6-properties-and-encapsulation):

```jac
obj Account {
    has _balance: float = 0.0,
        balance: float {
            getter -> float { return self._balance; }
            setter(value: float) { self._balance = value; }
        }
}
```

`jac check --lint --fix` rewrites the decorator form automatically
([`property-to-native`](#lint-rules-w3xxx-e3xxx)). As with `W2006`/`W2007`, a
Python-compat `class` is exempt. A cross-object `@Base.x.setter` extends a parent's
property and has no direct native form, so it is not reported.

### Declaration-Implementation Matching

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E2009` | Implementation could not be matched to a declaration |
| `W2010` | Abstract ability {name} should not have a definition |
| `E2011` | Parameter count mismatch for ability {name} |
| `E2012` | From the declaration of {name} |

### JSX Slot Body Rules

Emitted by `ViewLowerPass` when a `{...}` JSX slot's statement-template body violates the body-shape rules. See the [components tutorial](../tutorials/fullstack/components.md#jsx-slots-control-flow-as-children) for the underlying model.

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E2019` | A JSX slot renders template content and cannot 'return' a value. Use 'skip;' for slot early-exit, or move the value-producing expression outside the JSX slot. |
| `E2020` | Bare 'return;' is not allowed inside a JSX slot -- it reads like it exits the enclosing function, but a slot body is an inlined IIFE. Use 'skip;' for slot early-exit. |
| `E2021` | '{kw}' is not allowed inside a '{loop}' loop in a JSX slot. Use 'continue' to skip an iteration, or 'skip;' to exit the whole slot. |
| `E2022` | 'finally' is not allowed on a 'try' that has an 'awaiting' clause. The dispatched-but-not-joined window and finalization semantics are ambiguous together; move cleanup into an explicit mount/unmount hook or drop one of the clauses. |
| `E2023` | Redundant '{...}' slot wrapping inside a JSX slot body -- slot bodies are already in slot mode. Drop the outer braces: write '`<kw>` ... { ... }' directly instead of '{`<kw>` ... { ... }}'. |
| `E2024` | 'has' is not allowed inside a JSX slot body. A slot body is a statement template that re-runs on every render; declaring reactive state there would compile to a conditional 'useState' and violate React's rules of hooks. Declare 'has'-fields at the component scope (the enclosing 'def -> JsxElement' body). |
| `E2025` | A 'has'-field of type 'Ref[...]' must be constructed with an initializer: write '= Ref()' for a DOM ref, or '= Ref(initial)' for a value ref. It lowers to React's 'useRef', so a bare declaration has no ref object to hold -- '.current' would never be defined. This mirrors how every other 'has'-field carries a value. |
| `E2027` | Endpoint clause ': Src --> Tgt' is only valid on an 'edge' archetype, not on {arch_type} '{name}' |
| `E2084` | An expression without a trailing ';' is only treated as an implicit return when it is the final statement of a function, ability, or lambda body. |
| `W2019` | 'while' loop in a JSX slot renders JSX without a 'key' attribute -- add 'key=' so siblings keep their identity across re-renders. |
| `W2020` | 'awaiting' is not yet implemented on the '{target}' target -- the 'awaiting' clause body will be ignored at runtime. Only the 'cl' (react/preact) target currently lowers 'awaiting' to a Suspense fallback. |
| `W2021` | 'for' loop in a JSX slot renders JSX without a 'key' attribute -- annotate one child element with 'key=' so iteration siblings keep their identity across re-renders. |

---

## Lint Rules (W3xxx, E3xxx)

Emitted by `jac check --lint`. Rules can be configured in [`jac.toml`](config/index.md#checklint). The kebab-case name in brackets is used for `jac.toml` configuration.

| `W3022` | `nested-if-to-elif` | Nested 'if' in 'else' can be 'elif' | default |
| `W3023` | `simplify-return-bool` | `if cond return True else return False` can be simplified to `return cond` | default |
| `W3024` | `repeated-condition` | Repeated condition in if/elif chain | default |

| `W3039` | `getattr-to-null-ok` | getattr(obj, 'attr', None) should use null-safe access | default |
| `W3040` | `filter-compare-tautology` | Filter comparison '{name} == {name}' is always true | default |
| `W3041` | `stale-has-read` | Reactive `has` field '{name}' is read after being assigned in the same `can with entry` block | default |
| `W3042` | `map-lambda-to-comprehension` | `.map(lambda x -> any { return <jsx>; })` can be replaced with comprehension syntax | default |
| `W3050` | `strip-comments` | Comment can be removed | opt-in |
| `W3051` | `strip-docstrings` | Docstring can be removed | opt-in |

> **opt-in group**: `strip-comments` and `strip-docstrings` are destructive "deslop" rules. They are **never** activated by `select = ["all"]` or `["default"]`; they fire only when named explicitly in [`[check.lint]`](config/index.md#checklint). See the config reference for details.

### Formatter / Comment Injection

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `W5050` | Comment could not be placed precisely; emitting near end of formatted output |
| `E5051` | Formatter displaced {count} comment(s) to end of file -- refusing to save |

### Native IR Generation

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E5060` | C library import declaration '{name}' must not have a body |

### Client Code Generation

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `E5080` | Argument '{name}' for server function '{func}' is given both positionally and by keyword |
| `E5081` | Unknown client framework '{framework}' |
| `E5082` | Client code imports '{name}' from '{module}', but '{name}' has no client-side presence |
| `E5084` | Client code uses '{name}' from bare import '{module}', which resolves to no client-reachable module |

`E5082` fires when a plain client import references a server symbol that does not bridge: server `def:pub` endpoints bridge automatically over RPC, so the fix is to make the symbol a `def:pub` endpoint, pin it (or its module) `"client"` via `[placement.pins]`, or move it into client code.

`E5084` is the bare-import sibling. A bare name resolves across the module universe -- local Jac module first, then Python, then the client npm world (jac.toml `[dependencies.npm]`, the active framework's own packages, and whatever is installed under `.jac/client/node_modules`), so `import from react { useRef }` works unquoted. When the name resolves to none of those client-reachable worlds, placement pins the import server-side, the bundle never binds the symbol, and the page would fail at runtime with a ReferenceError -- so client use fails the build instead. Install or declare the package in `[dependencies.npm]` (or quote the module to pin the npm form), or keep the use server-side behind a `def:pub` endpoint. Annotation-only uses do not fire it, since ES output erases type annotations; imports whose uses are all server-side prune silently as before.

## Client Codespace Warnings (W6xxx)

### Cross-Codespace Portability

Emitted by `CapabilityCheckPass` when code uses JS-specific surface instead of Jac's common primitives, which work across all codespaces (Python, JS, native).

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `W6001` | Use of JS-specific global '{name}' -- use '{alternative}' for cross-codespace portability |
| `W6002` | Use of JS-idiomatic method '.{method}()' -- use '{alternative}' for cross-codespace portability |
| `W6003` | Use of JS-specific keyword '{name}' -- use '{alternative}' for cross-codespace portability |
| `W6004` | Use of JS-specific property '.{prop}' -- use '{alternative}' for cross-codespace portability |

### RPC Boundary

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `W6005` | Client call to server endpoint '{func}' passes function-typed parameter '{param}' -- functions cannot cross the RPC boundary |

A `def:pub` function in a server-placed module is an HTTP endpoint whose arguments serialize over the wire, so a function-typed argument cannot cross it. Shared client-side logic should drop `:pub` so it is placed in the browser with its callers.

### Placement Boundary

| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| `W6006` | Mutable glob '{name}' is emitted into both the server and the client -- each side gets an independent copy (state fork) |
| `W6007` | Client code uses server-placed function '{name}' as a value -- function values cannot cross the placement boundary |

`W6006`: dual emission duplicates *state*, not just code -- server writes and client writes land in different copies of the glob. Home the glob with its writers by pinning it (or its module) in `jac.toml` -- `[placement.pins] "mod.the_glob" = "server"` (or `"client"`) -- or bridge reads through a `def:pub` accessor.

`W6007`: the value-flow generalization of `W6005`. A function reference that flows into client-side data (stored in a container, returned, or passed along as an argument) needs client presence; only *calls* to `def:pub` endpoints bridge over RPC. Drop `:pub` so the function is pulled client-side, or restructure so the client stores data instead of the function. See [Placement](placement.md) for the full model.
