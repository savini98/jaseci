"""Native (.na.jac) ambient type stubs.

These model the native runtime surface that NaIRGenPass lowers directly to
LLVM (see compiler/passes/native/na_ir_gen_pass.impl/file_io.impl.jac). Unlike
jac_builtins.pyi / dom_types.pyi, this stub is NOT merged into the global
builtins: the TypeEvaluator resolves these names only inside .na.jac modules
(native context), so `File` and the native `open` never leak into regular Jac.

Signatures mirror the emitted File struct and methods so that File-typed code
type-checks accurately instead of degrading to UnknownType.
