"""Jac sitecustomize: shipped in the single binary's ``site/``.

Python imports ``sitecustomize`` during site initialization in BOTH the jac CLI
(``Py_Initialize`` + boot) and bare python mode (``jac -m <tool>`` via
``Py_BytesMain``). That makes it the one place to put the current project's
``.jac/venv`` on ``sys.path`` so it is visible to both -- the CLI's plugin
enumeration and a ``jac -m pytest``/``jac -m uvicorn`` that needs a tool
installed into the project venv.

Kept deliberately tiny and jaclang-free so non-Jac Python startup pays ~nothing.
