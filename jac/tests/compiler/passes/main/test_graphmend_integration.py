"""Torch-gated integration tests for GraphMend.

Confirm the *runtime* claim that the transformations defragment the FX graph:
compile each fixture with and without ``--graphmend`` and count how many
contiguous graphs TorchDynamo's backend actually receives. This is the paper's
metric -- a data-dependent branch / validation guard / side-effect call splits
the forward pass into multiple graphs; GraphMend collapses it back to one.

Graph count (via a counting backend) is used rather than
``explain().graph_break_count`` (which under-reports for small functions) or
``fullgraph=True`` (which is stricter than how models actually run -- it rejects
the harmless *trailing* break left by the side-effect epilogue flush even though
the expensive compute is a single contiguous graph).
