# Jac Cube Shooter - full-stack (`na` wasm + `cl` WebGL) via `jac start`

The same rlgl cube shooter as the parent example, as a **full-stack Jac app**: the
game is an `na {}` codespace compiled to WebAssembly, the page is a `cl {}` React
component, and `jac start` builds + serves both. One app module, no hand-run build
steps, no `.mjs`.

```bash
jac start          # build the cl bundle + na->wasm, serve on http://localhost:8000
jac start --dev    # same with hot reload
# open http://localhost:8000, click the canvas: WASD move, mouse/arrows aim,
# Space fire, Tab release the cursor
```

(`jac build` produces the same artifacts under `.jac/client/dist/` without serving.)

## How it fits together

```
main.jac
  na { import from raylib { ... }  ...game...  init()  frame()  get_score() }
        -> compiled to /static/main.wasm by the client build (pure-Jac wasm linker)
  cl { import from .raylib_shim { run_game };  def:pub app -> JsxElement { <canvas/> } }
        -> React bundle; on mount calls run_game(canvas)

raylib_shim.cl.jac   (reusable client library)
  emulates raylib's scalar rlgl immediate-mode API + input on WebGL/DOM,
  supplies the libc/__multi3 the Jac native runtime needs, instantiates
  /static/main.wasm, and drives init()/frame() per requestAnimationFrame.
```

The `na` block's `import from raylib { ... }` externs do **not** link a native
library here - they become the wasm module's **imports**, which `raylib_shim`
satisfies. Same source contract as the native build; a different host fulfills it.

### Why the shim is a separate `.cl.jac`

The shim is generic browser infra (a WebGL/DOM raylib emulation), not app code -
so it lives in a reusable `cl` library, imported like `react`. It is also where
the low-level glue (typed-array/`BigInt` marshalling, bitwise allocator math)
lives; a `.cl.jac` library is compiled but not strictly type-checked, which that
glue currently needs. The game and the page stay in `main.jac`.

## What's a shim vs. real raylib

This renders with a hand-written WebGL emulation of the rlgl subset the game uses

- it is raylib-*compatible*, not raylib itself.
